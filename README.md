# Cross-platform Mobile Development with Flutter S22 elective.

> Semester 6, 3rd study-year, Innopolis University.

**Flutter Project**. For this project, the [Backend](https://github.com/InnoQueue/Backend) project for the REST API was developed (please take into account this contribution 🙏).

## Team
- **name**: Haskell
- **team members**:
    - Timur Nugaev
    - Roman Soldatov
    - Emil Khabibullin

## 📌 About
- This application can be used to track household chores for roommates.
- A user can create a queue and invite his/her roommates.
- Users complete a queue task one by one in a loop. So, ideally, every roommate should complete a task on each iteration.

## List of screens

## List of features
- Create a new queue
- Invite users to a queue
- Complete a task when it's your turn
- Complete a task even it's not your turn. So, you will be skipped on the next iteration.
- Skip a task. However, on the next iteration, you will be forced to complete a task twice.
- Track expenses for tasks that require buying something.
- Temporarily leave a queue ("freeze"). Your progress will be saved, but you won't participate in a queue. For example, you can use this feature when you leave your room for the Winter holidays.
- If it's someone's turn you can "shake" him to remind him about a task by sending a notification.
- Receive reminders when it's your turn.
- Receive notifications about queue progress.
- Notifications history
- No registration is needed.
